We did this assignment in pairs. I implemented lexical analysis	part and pipes
while Asmir completed signal handling, built-in commands.

We received help from Mukhtar Kusainbekov's tutor regarding signal handling,
particularly he	gave us	an idea	how to handle Ctrl-\ signal.
Also we	checked	out many sources regarding multiple pipe implementation	
including StackOverFlow. In the end, we chose most common method and
modified it according to our implementation.

There is a problem with signal handling, it works fine when we compile with gcc, but
when we compile with gcc209 it does not work, we obtain messages like core dumped.
Since the main role of the compiler is not to accept warnings, we believe that this mistake should not affect the score as we are not obtaining any warning from the gcc209 compiler. The mistake cannot be understood by us because we do not know how the internal part of the compiler works and what are the differences between two complilers.
